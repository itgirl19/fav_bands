  <h2>The band</h2>
  <p>
   Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001.<br>
   The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley.<br>
   The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. <br>
   The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. <br>
   The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording the group's debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003). <br>
   The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, as well as some moderate commercial success. <br>
   Take This to Your Grave has commonly been cited as an influential blueprint for pop punk music in the 2000s.<br>
   With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, the band's 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the Cork Tree, <br>
   produced two hit singles, "Sugar, We're Goin Down" and "Dance, Dance," and went double platinum, <br>
   transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. <br>
   Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. The band's 2007 follow-up, <br>
   Infinity on High, landed at number one on the Billboard 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, <br>
   "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" and "Thnks fr th Mmrs." Folie à Deux, the band's fourth album, <br>
   created a mixed response from fans and commercially undersold expectations. <br>
   Following the release of Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits, the band took a hiatus from 2009 to 2012 to "decompress," exploring various side projects. <br>
   The band regrouped and recorded Save Rock and Roll (2013), <br>
   which gave the band its second career number one and produced the top 20 single "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)." <br>
   The group's sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015), <br>
   released worldwide on Island Records, was preceded by the top 10 hit "Centuries" and also spawned the single "Uma Thurman" which peaked at 22 on Hot 100.<br> 
   The album peaked at No. 1, making it the band's third No. 1 album and the group's fifth consecutive top 10 album.

  <h2>The music</h2>
  <p>
   While widely considered to be a pop punk band, Fall Out Boy has also been described as pop rock, emo, and emo pop,<br>
   and cites emo group The Get Up Kids as an influence among many other bands. <br>
   When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, <br>
   Pete Wentz stated that "Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids." Early in the band's career, <br>
   when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. <br>
   Wentz responded by "handing over the first two New Found Glory records".<br>
   Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences.<br>
   The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy.<br>
   Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying<br>
   "I think the interesting thing is that we are all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore. <br>
   That aspect is always going to be evident in the music. <br>
   We are hardcore kids that couldn't quite cut it as hardcore kids."<br>
   He referred to Fall Out Boy's genre as "softcore": hardcore punk mixed with pop sensibility. <br>
   Lead singer Patrick Stump, however, is also influenced by artists he listened to while growing up including Prince, Michael Jackson, and David Bowie.<br>
   Fall Out Boy's albums Take This to Your Grave and From Under the Cork Tree are both said to have pop punk as well as punk rock sounds and influences,<br>
   and Infinity on High features a wide range of styles and instrumentation, <br>
   including orchestral arrangements ("Thnks fr th Mmrs") and a slower piano ballad ("Golden"). <br>
   R&B influences on Infinity on High are on songs such as "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" <br>
   and two of the album's tracks are produced by R&B singer/producer Babyface. <br>
   On Folie à Deux, the group continues to evolve its sound, <br>
   with less of a pop punk sound and increasing the use of piano (such as "What a Catch, Donnie",<br> 
   "Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet", and "20 Dollar Nose Bleed"), synthesizers, and guest artists. <br>
   The band also shows a number of influences, with "Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes" borrowing a chord sequence from The Who song "Baba O'Riley".<br>
   The group has worked with many producers and artists, including The Neptunes, Timbaland, Ryan Adams, Lil Wayne and Kanye West, <br>
   the latter of which Patrick Stump described as "the Prince of his generation."<br>
   When the band returned from hiatus with Save Rock and Roll, their main goal was to reinvent the sound of the group from scratch, <br>
   creating what Trohman called a "reimagining of the band", which focused more on pop and moved away from the punk aspects of their sound.<br>
   [55] While mostly an album which mixes pop, rock and R&B, the record was still described by Dave Simpson of The Guardian as a pop punk record,<br>
   but also noted influences from Heart in the album's ballads. In American Beauty/American Psycho, <br>
   the band felt influences from playing with different artists and expanded on boundaries further than Save Rock and Roll did.<br>
   In an interview with Rolling Stone, guitarist Joe Trohman said the album has "hip hop grooves with guitars on it," <br>
   with "more in your face guitar than Save Rock and Roll".<br>
   Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press described American Beauty/American Psycho as a "mix of fluid grooves, punky riffs and outré pop sensibilities."<br>
   A central part of Fall Out Boy's sound is rooted in the band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, <br>
   who commonly uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories.<br>
   Wentz stated, "I write about what I’m going through most of the time, or what I imagine people are going through most of the time."<br>
   He draws inspiration from authors such as Charles Bukowski, Ernest Hemingway, and JT LeRoy, as well as rappers such as Lil Wayne, <br>
   who he described as his primary influence while writing Infinity on High. On Fall Out Boy's earlier works, <br>
   Wentz wrote primarily about love and heartbreak. Themes addressed on From Under the Cork Tree include narcissism and megalomania, <br>
   while many tracks on Infinity on High discuss the ups and downs of fame. While writing Folie à Deux, <br>
   he explored moral dilemmas and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment.<br>
   While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, <br>
   leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.
