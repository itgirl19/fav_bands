  <h2>The band</h2>
  <p>
   Panic! at the Disco is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 and featuring the current lineup of vocalist Brendon Urie, <br>
   accompanied on tour by bassist Dallon Weekes, guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich. Founded by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, <br>
   Brent Wilson and Urie, Panic! at the Disco recorded its first demos while its members were in high school. Shortly after, <br>
   the band recorded and released its debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the second single, <br>
   "I Write Sins Not Tragedies", the album was certified double platinum in the US. In 2006, <br>
   founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour, and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker.<br>
   Influenced by 1960s rock bands the Beatles, the Zombies and the Beach Boys, and preceded by the single "Nine in the Afternoon", <br>
   the band's second studio album, Pretty. Odd. (2008) marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, <br>
   who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. <br>
   The duo subsequently formed a new band, The Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.<br>
   Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, "New Perspective", <br>
   and recruited Dallon Weekes as the group's bassist and Ian Crawford as the band's lead guitarist to accompany the band during live performances. <br>
   Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010, nearing the end of the recording of the band's third studio album, <br>
   Vices & Virtues (2011). The album was recorded solely by Urie and Smith, with producers John Feldmann and Butch Walker.<br>
   As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, <br>
   in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, <br>
   leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members.<br>
   In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with the band since his departure in 2013. <br>
   Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, leaving Urie as the only member of the official lineup. <br>
   In April 2015, "Hallelujah" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016).

  <h2>The music</h2>
  <p>
   Panic! at the Disco have been know to change their sound each album. <br>
   Musically, they have mainly been described as pop rock, pop, pop punk, baroque pop, synth-pop, dance-punk, electropop, power pop, emo pop,<br>
   alternative rock and emo.<br>
   Panic! at the Disco went on record many times saying that the group's second album would be completely different from A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, <br>
   as Rolling Stone wrote in an article: "The group cemented its next direction with their first single, called "Nine in the Afternoon". <br>
   "It's influenced by the music our parents listened to: the Beach Boys, the Kinks, the Beatles," says Ross. <br>
   "Our new songs are more like classic rock than modern rock. <br>
   We got older and started listening to different music â€“ and this seems like the natural thing to do right now."<br>
   Pretty. Odd. has been described as being like "[Panic] dropping the entire Beatles catalog into a blender, <br>
   adding some modern alternative ice and the horn section from Sonia Dada, then churning out a new-millennium Liverpool smoothie."<br>
   In his review of the band's live album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted, <br>
   "...Pretty. Odd. suggests that they're becoming that rare thing in 2008: a pop-oriented rock band. <br>
   They might not be doing this knowingly, but the results are entertaining all the same."
